        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Shawn Gerk and I am currently a 2nd year Pre-Business student at the University of California, Riverside. As a pre-business student, Iâ€™m building a solid foundation for my future in the business world. I chose this path because Iâ€™m fascinated by what makes organizations successful, and I want to understand how decisions in finance, marketing, and management drive business outcomes. While I donâ€™t have everything mapped out yet, I know that gaining a broad range of skills and experiences now will set me up to pursue a variety of career opportunities later.
        In my classes, Iâ€™m focused on learning the core principles of business. My courses include subjects like economics, accounting, statistics, and introductory business concepts. Iâ€™m especially interested in how economics influences decision-making on both a macro and micro level; understanding supply and demand, for example, gives me a sense of how businesses adapt to market changes. Iâ€™m also learning about financial analysis, which is helping me build the quantitative skills needed to understand budgets, investments, and profitability. I see these classes as building blocks that will allow me to analyze and approach business problems from multiple angles.<br><br>

        Hands-on experience is important to me, too. I realized how different it is to actually apply concepts in a real-world setting, where things arenâ€™t as straightforward as they seem in textbooks. Being part of a team and having to make quick decisions in a fast-paced environment taught me about communication, collaboration, and the importance of adaptability. Iâ€™m hoping to land an internship in a corporate setting next, where I can see how larger companies operate and learn from people with more experience in the field. Iâ€™m also very involved on campus. I joined the AMA club, where Iâ€™ve met students who are just as driven and interested in business as I am. This has been a great way to network, and Iâ€™ve even found a few mentors in upperclassmen whoâ€™ve shared their insights on different business careers. Through the club, Iâ€™ve participated in social events, which challenge me to think critically and work with a team to come up with solutions to real business problems. These experiences are helping me improve my analytical and problem-solving skills, and theyâ€™ve given me a sense of what itâ€™s like to work under administration.<br><br>

        While Iâ€™m still exploring specific career paths, Iâ€™m interested in finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. Iâ€™ve considered going into finance because I enjoy working with numbers, but marketing intrigues me because itâ€™s about understanding people and influencing their decisions. Iâ€™m also drawn to entrepreneurship because of the freedom and creativity it allows. Ultimately, Iâ€™m keeping an open mind as I continue to build my skills and gain experience. Overall, being a pre-business student is both challenging and exciting. Iâ€™m laying the groundwork for my future, and Iâ€™m eager to see where this path will take me. I know that with the right blend of knowledge, experience, and hard work, I can build a successful career in whatever field I choose.
